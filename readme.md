# Portfolio Maker using vanilla JavaScript

Site is live:
https://portfolio-maker-vanillajs.netlify.app/

## Why make it?:
I could not find any website that allows you to create a portfolio using vanilla JavaScript, without using any framework or jQuery. So I decided to create one.

-----

## Working
I have created a website that allows you to create a portfolio using vanilla JavaScript.
It is a multi page application that will generate a single page application as output.

It only uses HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript.

### Future Work (march 2023):
Make it responsive
Purge extra CSS from output
